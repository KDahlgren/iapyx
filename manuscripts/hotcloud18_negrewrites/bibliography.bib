abstract="It is very unusual for a mathematical idea to disseminate into the society at large. An interesting example is chaos theory, popularized by Lorenz's butterfly effect: ``does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' A tiny cause can generate big consequences! Can one adequately summarize chaos theory in such a simple minded way? Are mathematicians responsible for the inadequate transmission of their theories outside of their own community? What is the precise message that Lorenz wanted to convey? Some of the main characters of the history of chaos were indeed concerned with the problem of communicating their ideas to other scientists or non-scientists. I'll try to discuss their successes and failures. The education of future mathematicians should include specific training to teach them how to explain mathematics outside their community. This is more and more necessary due to the increasing complexity of mathematics. A necessity and a challenge!",
